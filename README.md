# 🔐 Password Strength Predictor

This project is a simple **Streamlit-based web application** that analyzes and predicts the strength of a given password. It classifies the password as **Weak**, **Normal**, or **Strong** based on its composition (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).

---

## 📁 **Project Overview**

This project uses machine learning models trained with:
- A custom classification model (saved as `model.pkl`)
- A vectorizer for text preprocessing (saved as `vectorizer.pkl`)

The app uses the Streamlit library to provide an interactive user interface where users can input their passwords and get instant predictions about password strength.

## 📦 **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-predictor.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

```bash
cd password-strength-predictor
```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Unix/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the Streamlit App**:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📝 **Usage**

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Type your password into the input field.
3. Press **Enter** or click the **"Predict"** button.
4. The system will classify your password as **Weak**, **Normal**, or **Strong**.

---

## 🔍 **How It Works**

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The input password is processed to analyze its composition (letters, numbers, special characters).
  
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - The password is transformed using a **text vectorizer** and combined with custom features such as:
     - Length of the password
     - Frequency of lowercase characters
     - Frequency of uppercase characters
     - Frequency of numbers
     - Frequency of special characters

3. **Prediction**:
   - A **pre-trained classification model** is loaded to make the prediction.
